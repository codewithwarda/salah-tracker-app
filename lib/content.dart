      """
Long ago, in a faraway city named Nineveh, people were doing many wrong things.
Allah sent Yunus (AS) to guide them — to call them to truth and kindness.
      """,
      """
But the people didn’t listen.
Prophet Yunus (AS) was heartbroken and left the city without Allah's command.
He boarded a ship with others, hoping to travel far away...
      """,
      """
A huge storm came! The ship rocked wildly.
To save the ship, they decided to throw someone off.
They drew lots — and Prophet Yunus (AS)'s name came up.
      """,
      """
Prophet Yunus (AS) was thrown into the sea...
A huge fish swallowed him — but he was not harmed.
Inside the belly of the whale, it was dark and quiet.
      """,
      """
He heard the fishes saying tasbih — glorifying Allah.
So he prayed from his heart:
"لَّآ إِلٞاهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّى كُنْتُ مِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ"
"Laa ilaaha illa Anta, Subhaanaka inni kuntu minaz-zalimeen"
(There is no God but You. Glory be to You. I was surely among the wrongdoers.)
      """,
      """
Allah forgave him and brought him safely out of the whale.
A special gourd plant (yaqteen) grew next to him — with big leaves to give him shade.
He rested and healed under its soft green cover.
